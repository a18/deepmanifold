    "# Deep Manifold Traversal with LFW\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Download the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset from http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/. You will need the lfw_attributes.txt file, as well as the standard (un-aligned) set of images, available directly from http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz. You will need to unzip this dataset in the 'images/' directory.\n",
    "2. Install caffe+pycaffe http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/  (or symlink to an installation of caffe) in the directory directly above deepmanifold/. \n",
    "3. Download the 19 layer VGG weights and layer configuration from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/, and place them in ../caffe/models/VGG_CNN_19/\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need the following python packages, which can be installed with pip:\n",
    "    * pillow>=2.7.0,<3.0\n",

If you change the image resolution, however, you will need to find lambdas that work for you. In general, we've found that higher resolution images require smaller lambdas to get the same effect because the norm of delta increases. \n",

We've found that the algorithm is relatively insensitive to this as long as the kernel values are \"reasonable\" (i.e., not extremely small or very close to 1). In all of our experiments, we set rbf_var so that the values of KA and KB (currently printed out when you run dmt) were around 0.5."
